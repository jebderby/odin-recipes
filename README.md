This project is part of the work I am studying with through The Odin Project (TOP).
Website for this recipes work can be found on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.

Item 1: Initial Structure
1.1 - Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.
1.2 - Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

This demonstrates the ability to create, manipulate and move folders, while familiarizing with the 
boiler plate HTML text that you use. 

Item 2: Recipe Page

2.1 - Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
2.2 - Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example lasagna.html. You can use the name of your favorite dish.
2.3 - For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
2.4 - Back in the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. 
Example: Under the <h1>Odin Recipes</h1> heading, write out the link like so: <a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.

This demonstrates how to develop a webpage with basic functions.

Item 3: Recipe Page Content
3.1 - An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. 
3.2 - Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
3.3 - Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
3.4 - Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

This demonstrates adding images and including more text on the webpage

Item 4: Add more recipes
4.1 - Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
4.2 - Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.

This demonstrates how to add more recipe pages and how to link them to the main page on the index.html
